# NonGravitar

## GAMEPLAY
As the title suggest in NonGravitar there's no gravity. The "V" is your spaceship, the goal is to destroy more planet you can, with the arrow keys you can move the spaceship and enter in the planet. 
Once entered the planet use the spacebar to shoot the enemies (in red), and the left shift button to pick up the fuel tank.
Only when all the planet in the current Solar System are destroyed you can go with the spaceship on the right edge of the screen and go to the next solar system. If you want to go back to the previous Solar System go the left edge.
Please note that a planet is destroyed if and only if all the enemy/bunker in it are destroyed nonetheless is it possible to go back in a
destroyed planet (for example to pick up more fuel).
The gameplay terminate if you have no more fuel or health points, but you can choose if close the program or restart another game.
